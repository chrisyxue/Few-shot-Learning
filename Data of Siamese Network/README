This directory contains a set of faces taken between April 1992 and
April 1994 at the Olivetti Research Laboratory in Cambridge, UK.

There are 10 different images of 40 distinct subjects. For some of the
subjects, the images were taken at different times, varying lighting
slightly, facial expressions (open/closed eyes, smiling/non-smiling)
and facial details (glasses/no-glasses).  All the images are taken
against a dark homogeneous background and the subjects are in
up-right, frontal position (with tolerance for some side movement).
